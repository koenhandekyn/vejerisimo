    description: "Vejer de la Frontera is a small hilltop town and has spectacular views to the sea, the mountains, the river and even Africa. Breathe the Andalusian air in this whitewashed village surrounded by a wonderful nature. Its narrow streets take us back in time and evoke ancient Arabic scenarios. Discover picturesque corners, medieval gates, flowered patios and the important craft tradition. The white sanded beaches of El Palmar are only 10 minutes away. <br/>Vejer de la Frontera has recently been proclaimed as the second most beautiful village of Spain by TripAdviser. The village offers you, with its unspoilt character, the real Andalucia. The flamenco for example hasn’t been commercialized yet. Enjoy the authentic flamenco e.g. in the intimate setting of the Peña Flamenca. Vejer also has a high level of gastronomy and the white sanded beaches of El Palmar are only 10 minutes away."
